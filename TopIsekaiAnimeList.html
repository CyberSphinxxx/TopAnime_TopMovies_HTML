    <h1>1. Ishura</h1>

    <p>Unlike so many series, Ishura does not immediately highlight its isekai qualities. Rather than instantly focusing on "visitors" from another world, the anime introduces Yuno, a magical user who is attending an academy in a world that seems to have entered a peaceful era due to the death of the Demon King. Unfortunately, that assumption proves to be false, and her city and only friend are decimated by an army of golems.</p>

And, the source material allows Yogiri, the male lead, to use this ability frequently and to the detriment of many other characters who are too arrogant to realize they might be outmatched.</p>
